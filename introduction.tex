\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Unified Modelling Language (UML)~\cite{UML2015OMG} is the \emph{de facto} standard for object-oriented software and systems modelling. 
It offers a broad range of abstractions that can be used to express different views of a system, including Class, Use Case, State, Collaboration and Sequence diagrams. 
Since version 2.0, UML offers a domain-specific extension and customisation mechanism named  \emph{UML Profiling}~\cite{FuentesFernandez2004:UMLME}. 
Using UML Profiles users can add new concepts to the modelling language in the form of \textit{Stereotypes}. 
Each Stereotype extends a core UML concept (e.g., Class, Actor, etc.) and includes extra information that 
supports the modelling needs of users of the target domain that is missing from the base concept.

With profiles, UML offers a way for users to build Domain-Specific Modelling Languages (DSML) by re-using and extending UML concepts. 
Although domain-specific modelling languages and tools that support them, like Sirius~\cite{viyovic2014sirius} or Eugenia~\cite{kolovos2015eugenia}, are becoming more popular, UML is still widely used in model-based software 
engineering (MBSE)~\cite{erickson2007theoretical}. 
As a result, alternative ways to define domain-specific languages using dedicated metamodels and textual/graphical editors are available to the users~\cite{Bergmayr2014:MODELS,Pardillo2010:MODELS}. 
%Those approaches have their benefits and shortcomings which are, however, beyond the scope of this paper.   

Papyrus \cite{lanusse2009papyrus} is a leading open-source UML modelling tool developed under the Eclipse Foundation and driven by the PolarSys Initiative and the Papyrus Industry Consortium, which are spearheaded by large high-technology companies such as Airbus, Thales, Saab and Ericsson. 
After more than a decade in development, Papyrus is close to developing a critical mass for wider adoption in industry as means of (1) escaping proprietary UML tooling lock-in, (2) leveraging the MBSE-related developments in the Eclipse modelling ecosystem enabling automated management of UML models (e.g. model validation and model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformation languages), and (3) enabling multi-paradigm modelling using a combination of UML and EMF-based DSLs. 
Widely used UML profiles, like SysML~\cite{friedenthal2014practical} and MARTE~\cite{omg2011marte} offer implementations for Papyrus. 
However, the ability of Papyrus to support non-trivial UML profiles and the effort and learning curve related to developing such profiles are recurring concerns. 
As reported in~\cite{Wimmer2009:IJWIS}, the manual definition of new UML profiles is typically a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone process.

In this paper, we simplify and automate the process of developing UML profiles for Papyrus. We propose an approach supported by a prototype Eclipse plugin, where annotated Ecore metamodels are used to capture the abstract and graphical syntax of profiles at a high-level of abstraction, and are then automatically transformed to the Papyrus-specific artefacts for distribution and deployment. 
In particular, our approach, called AMIGO, produces a fully-fledged UML profile and a distributable Papyrus graphical editor as an Eclipse plugin. 

We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for the automatic generation of a non-trivial enterprise modelling language (Archimate) and its corresponding Papyrus editor against an equivalent developer-driven UML profile and Papyrus editor. 
Furthermore, we apply our approach on several other DSMLs of varying size and complexity~\cite{williams2013metamodels}, demonstrating its generality and wide applicability.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. 
Section~\ref{sec:background} motivates the need of the proposed approach. 
Section~\ref{sec:approach} describes the proposed approach while in Section~\ref{sec:implementation} the implementation details are given. 
In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we present the evaluation carried out, while in Section~\ref{sec:related} related work is discussed. 
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:future} concludes the paper and highlights plans for future work.
