\begin{abstract}
We present an approach for defining the abstract and concrete syntax of UML profiles using annotated Ecore metamodels, and for deriving Papyrus-specific implementation-level artefacts from such metamodels using automated model-to-model and model-to-text transformations. We evaluate our approach by comparing it against manual UML profile specification and implementation using a non-trivial enterprise modelling language (Archimate) as a case study, and we demonstrate the substantial productivity and maintainability benefits it delivers.
