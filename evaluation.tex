\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we evaluate Jorvik in three different ways. 
In the first evaluation, we apply Jorvik to generate a Papyrus editor for the non-trivial Archimate UML profile~\cite{iacob2009archimate,haren2012archimate}. 
We use the Adocus Archimate for Papyrus\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Adocus/ArchiMate-for-Papyrus}} (an open-source tool that includes a profile for Archimate and the appropriate editors for Papyrus) for reference. 
We compare the proportion of the tool that Jorvik is able to generate automatically, check the number of polishing transformations that the user needs to write to complete the missing parts and finally, identify the aspects of the editor that our approach is not able to generate.
As a result we can measure the \textit{efficiency} of Jorvik in generating profiles/editors against an existing relatively large profile/editor. 

In the second evaluation, we assess the \textit{completeness} of Jorvik by applying it to a number of metamodels collected as part of the work presented in~\cite{williams2013metamodels}. 
This way, Jorvik is tested to check if it can successfully generate profiles and editors for a wide variety of scenarios.

In the third evaluation, we conduct a \textit{user experiment} in which we asked software engineers to build Papyrus editors for two UML Profiles. 
We first ask the engineers to create the profiles and editors manually, and then ask them to create the same profiles and editors using Jorvik. 
We measure the time, report problems encountered during the experiment for both approaches and we compare the results.

\subsection{Efficiency}
\label{sec:efficiencyEvaluation}
The Archimate for Papyrus tool offers five kinds of diagrams (i.e., Application, Business, Implementation and Migration, Motivation and Technology diagrams). 
Each of the diagrams uses different stereotypes from the Archimate profile. 
In this scenario, we create five Ecore metamodels and annotate the elements that need to appear as nodes/edges in the diagrams. 
We then generate the editors for all the five Archimate diagrams.
At this point, five fully functional editors are generated that can be used to create each of the five types of diagrams that the Archimate for Papyrus tool also supports. 

However, our generated editors do not offer some special features that the Archimate for Papyrus tool offers. 
For example, Archimate for Papyrus offers a third drawer in the palette for some diagrams that is called ``Common'' and includes two tools (named ``Grouping'' and ``Comment''). 
Another feature that is not supported by our default transformations is the fact that in Archimate for Papyrus, users are able to have the elements represented either by their shapes or by a coloured rectangle depending on the CSS class applied to them. 
Finally, Archimate for Papyrus also organises the creation of the \textit{Junction} (which is a node that acts as a junction for edges) node in the relations' drawer in the palette.
In order to be able to implement such missing features, we need to write the extra polishing transformations. 
We do not go into details on the content of the polishing transformations for this specific example\footnote{The generated Plug-ins for Archimate and the polishing transformations are available from \url{https://github.com/wrwei/Jorvik}}.

In our previous work \cite{zolotas2018towards}, we compared our approach with Archimate for Papyrus. 
However, as we mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:background}, Papyrus changed its underlying metamodels and the mechanism for creating UML specific editors. 
Thus, we generated all the Archimate editors using Jorvik, which are compatible to Papyrus 3.0+ (Archimate for Papyrus does not support Papyrus 3.0+). \thanos{This is very confusing but I cannot think of a way to write it. But definitelly has to change.}

Table~\ref{tab:evaluation} summarises the efficiency of Jorvik, both for Jorvik pre-Papyrus 3.0 version and for Jorvik post-Papyrus 3.0 version\footnote{Cells in gray are artefacts not needed for implementation. E.g. Creation Command and Architecture Model are concepts in Papyrus version 3.0+, and therefore are not applicable to Jorvik pre-Papyrus 3.0 version and Archimate for Papyrus}. The numbers are shown in the format of \textit{Lines of Code (Number of Model Elements)}, as we count both the lines of code and (equivalent) number of model elements needed to be manually created. For artefacts which are not models (e.g., the CSS file) we only provide the lines of code metric as well for artefact created by polishing transformations in Jorvik, as these were generated by the polishing transformation scripts.


For Jorvik pre-Papyrus 3.0 (columns under \textit{Jorvik (pre-Papyrus 3.0)}), we need to manually create five annotated Ecore metamodels, which involves writing 436 lines of code (668 model elements). 
For polishing transformations, we need to write 11 lines of code in the transfornation scripr for Element Types Configuration, 50 lines for Palette Configuration, 195 lines for CSS and 10 lines for Types Configuration.

For Jorvik post-Papyrus 3.0 (columns under \textit{Jorvik (post-Papyrus 3.0)}), we need the same Ecore metamodels, thus the numbers do not change. 
For polish transformations, we need to write 50 lines for the Palette Configuration and 195 lines for CSS. 

As it can be observed from the numbers, our approach requires about 90\% less handwritten code to produce the basic diagrams and about 85\% less code to 
produce the polished editor that matches the original Archimate for Papyrus editor. 
%The produced by Jorvik editors match those included in the original Archimate for Papyrus tool.
Our approach creates the five diagram editors which offer the same functionality and features as the original Archimate for Papyrus tool but also atop that the ETL transformation and the OCL constraints.

\end{landscape}

\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}
There were a few minor features of the original Archimate for Papyrus tool that our approach could not support. 
Most of them are related to custom menu entries and wizards. For those to be created developer needs to extend the ``plugin.xml'' file. 
In addition, the line decoration shapes of stereotypes that extend the aggregation base element (i.e., diamond) can only be applied dynamically by running Java code that will update the property each time the stereotype is applied. 
Our default and polishing transformations are not able to generate those features automatically; these should be implemented manually. 
For that reason, we \textit{excluded} these lines of code needed by Archimate for Papyrus to implement these features from the data provided in Table~\ref{tab:evaluation} for a fair comparison. 

\subsection{Completeness}
\label{sec:completenessEvaluation}
In addition to the generation of the Archimate profile/editors, we tested Jorvik with nine more Ecore metamodels from different domains. 
The names of the metamodels (including Archimate) and their size (in terms of types) are given in Table~\ref{tab:metamodels}. \thanos{This is shown as ??, the tex code looks correct though. Do you know what's wrong?}
Next to the size, in parenthesis, the number of types that should be transformed so they can be instantiated as nodes/edges is also provided.

		\cline{1-4}
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:metamodels}
	\caption{The names and sizes of the ten metamodels against which the approach was evaluated to test completeness}
\end{table}

As illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:metamodels}, the metamodels varied in size, from small profiles (having 5 stereotypes) to large profiles (up to 57 
stereotypes). 
The approach was able to produce the profiles and the editors for \textit{all} the metamodels, demonstrating that it can be used to generate the 
desired artifacts for a wide spectrum of domains. 
The time needed for the generation varied from miliseconds up to a few seconds. 
In the future, we plan to assess further the scalability of our approach using larger metamodels.

\subsection{User Experiment}
We have argued that Jorvik provides significant gains in productivity when building custom UML Profile editors for Papyrus.
We design a user experiment to substantiate such claim, and ascertain how significant the productivity gain can be.
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}, there are eight major steps to be taken in order to create a UML profile as well as its supporting editor. 
In this experiment, we compare the time needed to develop an editor using the Papyrus infrastructure (referred to as \textit{Papyrus approach from now on}) with the time need to develop the same editor using Jorvik.
For the Papyrus approach we design eight tasks, each with its own deadline (see Table~\ref{tab:manual} for the participants to complete towards manually creating a working UML profile editor.
For Jorvik, we designed one task for the participants to complete to automatically generate a working UML profile editor.
We ask two participants to take part in the experiment and work on two profiles we choose. 
We record the time taken for the participants to complete the experiment using both approaches and we compare the times.

\subsubsection{Papyrus Approach Experiment Set-Up}
For the purpose of this experiment, we have chosen a participant with relatively more experience in modelling, and a candidate with less experience in modelling. 
Both participants have an Eclipse IDE installed on their computers, with Eclipse Epsilon 1.6 Interim version\footnote{\url{https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/}} and Eclipse Papyrus 4.0.0\footnote{\url{https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus/download.html}} installed.
We asked the participants to perform the eight tasks involved in the Papyrus apporach firstly on one profile (the Website profile\footnote{\url{https://github.com/wrwei/Jorvik/tree/master/org.papyrus.website}}) and then repeat the experiment for a second profile (the Fault Tree profile\footnote{\url{https://github.com/wrwei/Jorvik/tree/master/org.papyrus.faulttree}}) following again the Papyrus apporach. 
The SVG shapes and icons for both the case were give to the participants ready to use. 
\thanos{Somewhere in this subsection we need to explain how we came up with the times (double the ammount needed by an expert) and the rational behind the deadline (i.e., when we did it for first time it took months so we had to have a timeout.)}
Before the experiment is conducted, a pre-experiment questionnaire is handed to the participants, to assess their expertise in UML, UML profiles and Papyrus. \thanos{Refer to where redears can find the questionnaires}
In addition, a 20-30 minutes introduction to UML profiles and Papyrus is given to them while an example of a custom UML profile Papyrus editor is being presented to them. For each of the eight steps, there is a set deadline; the participants are asked to try to complete the step within the deadline.
In each step, the participants are asked to complete a minimal task first (e.g. for UML profile, create a \textit{Stereotype} that is displayed as a node and a \textit{Stereotype} that is displayed as an edge)\footnote{Detailed descriptions of the tasks can be found at \url{https://github.com/wrwei/Jorvik/tree/master/User\%20Experiment}}. They are asked to continue with the rest if there is still time left, while, if the deadline is missed but they were close to the correct solution, they are asked to give an estimate of how long they believe it would take them to finish the whole step.
At the beginning of each step, we provide a piece of \textit{Default} knowledge, which covers ground knowledge for the step to be completed. 
Participants are also allowed to search for any information over the Internet which may assist them in their tasks at any point during the experiment.
At a certain point for each step, we assess if the participants are able to complete the step within the time frame, and we provide a piece of \textit{Essential} knowledge, which contains key information (parts of which are not accessible from the Internet)\thanos{strong argument, shots fired: "Have you searched the whole Internet?"} for the participants to complete the step.

	\label{tab:manual}
\end{table}


The overview of the tasks is provided in Table~\ref{tab:manual}. The detailed task descriptions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item UML Profile - An image of a UML profile is provided to the participants, they are required to create the profile within 60 minutes.
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	40 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item Element Types Configuration Model - Participants are asked to create an Element Types Configuration model for the editor within 60 minutes. 
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	40 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item Palette Configuration Model - Participants are asked to create a Palette Configuration model for the editor within 30 minutes.
	 \thanos{We repeat these two sentences eveywhere.}The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning.
	20 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item Custom Style - Participants are asked to create a CSS file to customise the styles of the editor within 30 minutes.
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	20 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item Creation Command - Participants are asked to create a Java class to initialise the Papyrus diagram within 30 minutes.
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	20 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item Architecture Model - Participants are asked to create an Architecture model for the editor within 40 minutes.
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	30 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item Plug-in Configuration - Participants are asked to configure their plug-ins in order to make use of all the models/artefacts to form a working editor, within 20 minutes.
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	12 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
	\item OCL constraints (optional) - In this optional task, participants are asked to create OCL constraints mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:constraints} for all connector \textit{Stereotype}s, within 60 minutes. 
	We do not expect this task to be taken by participants, as it typically required experienced OCL experts 2 weeks to complete the constraint templates described in Section~\ref{sec:constraints}.
	For the record, no participants agreed to take this optional task.
\end{enumerate}

For each step, when participants express that they have completed the step, we stop the timer and assess the solutions. 
If the solutions are not correct, we tell the participants that they need more work and resume the timer.
Since each step depends on the previous being completed, at the beginning of each step, the participants are given a solution that contains complete and correct assets for all the previous tasks.

After participants have completed the manual process, a post-experiment questionnaire is handed to them, in which they evaluate the difficulties of each task and if enough time was provided for each task.

The experiment then proceeds Jorvik, where they need to complete one task (see Table~\ref{tab:automatic}):\thanos{again I see ?? here I don't how to fix.}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Annotated Ecore Metamodel and Generation - Participants are provided with the same image of the profiles, they are asked to create an annotated Ecore metamodel for the profile, and generate the UML profile and the editor, within 50 minutes.
	The \textit{Default} information is provided at the beginning. 
	30 minutes in the task, we assess the participants' status and provide the \textit{Essential} information.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
In total Participant \#2 spent 206 minutes using the Papyrus approach for the Fault Tree profile.


Using Jorvik, participant \#1 was able to generate the correct Papyrus editor for the Website profile in 32 minutes. She was also able to create the correct editor for the Fault Tree profile in 15 minutes.
Participant \#2 needed 37 minutes and 38 minutes for the creation of a correct Papyrus editor for the Website and the Fault Tree profiles, respectively, using Jorvik.

\subsubsection{Analysis}
Comparing the Papyrus approach with Jorvik, we can conclude that using Jorvik users are able to increase the productivity by at least 10 times. 
We draw this conclusion based on the data presented in Table~\ref{tab:experiment} (especially when participants claim that they would need additional time to finish the complete solution for some steps), and also based on the fact that both participants chose not to complete the optional Step 8 (the OCL constraints), which may take significant time, even for experience OCL programmers.

We are also able to draw the conclusion that it is rather difficult to derive the models/artefacts needed for a working UML profile-specific editor. 
This is based on the experiment results that both participants got the majority of their models/artefacts wrong for the Website profile, which was the first profile and editor they worked on.
Although we provided the \textit{Essential} information, which is not publicly available on the Internet\thanos{same as before, strong argument which we cannot prove. Maybe say "to the best of our knowledge not part of the Papyrus online documentation}, the participants still could not get the models/artefacts right because of the inter-related nature of the models.
This is the direct evidence that creating a UML profile editor in Papyrus is a labour-intensive and error-prone process.\thanos{Just remember that we need to change UML profile editor to *distributable* UML profile editor. }

When participants worked on the Fault Tree profile, they were able to refer to their solutions to the Website profile. 
Therefore we observe that the correctness of the models/artefacts for the Fault Tree profile improved significantly comparing to the Website profile. This matches our experience with using the Papyrus infrastructure fo the development of distributable editors for UML profiles, where we had to reverse engineer other editors available online to try to understand how to proceed.
Although they may have adapted their Website soutions to their Fault Tree solution, the recorded time shows that Jorvik still dominates the manual process, especially taking the OCL constraints into consideration.

[\textbf{TODO: Other things to discuss 1) One of our participants expert in Ecore. 2) We've seen people having hard time to test what they have done so far. With Papyrus you need to have a near-complete solution to check progres. Jorvik has validation messages that display possibly useful information. We've seen that these messages helped both participants. }]

\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}
For the experiment we could not find experts that specialise in creating UML profiles and their supporting editors for Papyrus. 
This is typically due to the fact that this feature of Papyrus is not widely promoted and used.
However, we have manually created the Website profile and its editor and recorded the time it took us to finish the whole solution. 
We derive the deadlines for the steps in the manual process based on our time (we multiplied our time by a factor of 2). \thanos{OK, I have a note above, please move this, there.}
\textbf{[TODO: Other threats: 1) People were asked to execute tasks in a waterfall way. Normally, when we do this proceess, we go back and forth between the artefacts, make changes, test, fix, go back, make changes in antoher model etc. etc. ]}



[\textbf{TODO: General remark: 1) Pilot study is not referred anywhere. It should be referred in the experiment setup to highlight that the experiment was refined. 2) The results of the questionnaire are not presented and discussed. I also noticed tha the questionnaires appendix is missing.}]
