\section{Proposed Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

\sg{In order to minimise the labour intensive and repetitive process required for the definition of a UML Profile and its relevant Papyrus-specific implementation level artefacts, we propose Jorvik, an automatic generation tool for Papyrus UML profiles and their editors. }\SG{Identical to the sentence above.} 
Through Jorvik, developers can define the abstract syntax and the concrete (graphical) syntax of their DSLs (the UML profile) in the form of an annotated Ecore metamodel.
The annotations can be used to specify the \textit{Stereotyp}s to be created in the UML profile, and what meta-elements they extend. 
With the annotations, the developers can also specify the graphical syntax and related information (e.g. shapes for the \textit{Stereotype}s and the icons for the creation tools in the palette). 
The annotated Ecore metamodel is then processed by Jorvik and transformed into a UML profile and related Papyrus-specific models/files needed for a standalone Papyrus editor. This is done hrough a series of model management operations like model validation, model-to-model (M2M) and model-to-text (M2T) transformations. An overview of our proposed approach is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:approachOverview}. 
We discuss the steps involved in the process in detail in the remainder of this section, followed by a running example. 
Technical details about the different steps of the proposed approach are provided in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.

The first step is to create an annotated Ecore metamodel to define the intended DSL.
In order to do this, a number of annotation keywords are defined for the users to use:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item \textbf{@Diagram} annotations are used to define diagram-specific information like the name and the icon of the diagram. This annotation can be applied to EPackages and should always be applied to the EPackage at the top level.
	\item \textbf{@Node} annotations are used to indicate the \textit{Stereotype}s that should be instantiated as nodes in the diagrams. 
	The UML meta-element that this \textit{Stereotype} extends is provided through the \emph{base} property. 
	The SVG shape to be used on the canvas and the icon of the specific element in the palette are specified through the \emph{shape} and \emph{icon} properties, respectively. 
	\item \textbf{@Edge} annotations are used to denote \textit{Stereotype}s that should be instantiated as edges in the diagrams. 
	The UML meta-element extended by this stereotype is provided through the \emph{base} property. The icon of the specific element in the palette is also passed as property along with the desired style of the line. 
	This annotation can be applied either to an EClass or to an EReference.
\end{enumerate}

In the metamodel, all annotated \textit{EClass}es are automatically transformed into \textit{Stereotypes}.
\textit{Stereotype}s are also created from annotated EReferences (more about this below). 
Depending on the required graphical syntax of the \textit{Stereotype} (i.e., if it should be represented as a \textit{node} or as an \textit{edge} on the diagram), developers need to use the appropriate annotation on EClasses/EReferences. 
A detailed list of all valid annotation properties is provided in Appendix~\ref{appendixA}. 

With the annotated Ecore metamodel in place, the next step is to check the validity of the annotations in order to proceed with the generation process. 
Therefore, a custom-made model validation script written in the Epsilon Validation Language (EVL)~\cite{evlKolovos} (see Figure~\ref{fig:approachOverview}) is used.
The validation rules (which we describe in detail in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}) check if the annotations provided and their attributes match the expected ones by Jorvik (e.g., each annotated element includes a reference to the UML base element it extends). 
If the validation fails, feedback is provided to users to fix the problems detected. 
Otherwise, the annotated Ecore metamodels are consumed by a workflow of M2M and M2T  transformations illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:transformationWorkflow} and described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. 
The transformations are written in the Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL)~\cite{Kolovos2008} and the Epsilon Generation Language (EGL)~\cite{rose2008egl}. 
In principle, any other model validation, M2M and M2T language could be used (e.g., ATL~\cite{jouault2006atl}). 
The transformations produce the UML profile with the appropriate OCL constraints and all the configuration models and files needed by Papyrus. 
In addition, an M2M transformation is also generated that can be used later by developers to transform the UML models that conform to the generated UML profile, back to EMF models that conform to the Ecore metamodel used as source. 
Model management programs already developed to run against model conforming to the EMF metamodel can be re-used.

Jorvick offers the option of \textit{polishing transformations}, where developers are able to write their own (optional) transformations to fine-tune the generated artefacts produced by the built-in transformations. 
In the following section, the proposed approach is explained via a running example.

\subsection{Running Example}
\label{sec:example}
In this example we define a DSL - the Simple Development Process Language (SDPL) - in an annotated Ecore metamodel and we generate the corresponding UML profile and Papyrus graphical editor using Jorvik.
We start by defining the abstract syntax of the DSL using  Emfatic\footnote{\url{https://www.eclipse.org/emfatic/}}, a textual notation for Ecore, which is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:annotatedSdplEmfatic} (ignore the annotations at this point). 
A process defined in SDPL consists of \textit{Steps}, \textit{Tools} and \textit{Persons} participating in it. 
Each \textit{Person} is familiar with certain tools and can have different \textit{Role}s in steps of a process, while each step refers to the next step that follows using the \textit{next} reference.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\lstinputlisting[caption={The annotated Emfatic code that defines the 
		metamodel 
		of\\ SDPL and can be used to generate the UML profile and the 
		associated \\Papyrus 
		editor.},
	label={lst:annotatedSdplEmfatic},
	captionpos=b, 
	language=Emfatic, 
	tabsize=2, 
	numbers=left, 
	numbersep=5pt, 
	numberstyle=\tiny,  
	breaklines=true]{sdplAnnotated.emf}
	\vspace*{-5mm}
\end{figure}

In order to generate the UML profile and the Papyrus graphical editor we need to add the following concrete syntax-related annotations shown in Listing~\ref{lst:annotatedSdplEmfatic}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] \textbf{Line 2:} The name and the icon that should be used by Papyrus in the custom diagrams menus are defined using the \textit{name} and \textit{icon} properties of the \textit{@Diagram} annotation.
	\item[--] \textbf{Lines 5, 10 \& 15:} The \textit{@Node} annotation is used to define that the three concepts (i.e., Steps, Roles and Tools) should be \textit{Stereotype}s in the UML profile that will be represented as nodes on the diagram. 
	The \textit{base} parameter is used to define which UML meta-element the \textit{Stereotype} should extend (i.e., \textit{Class}\footnote{Although profiles are meant to accommodate ``natural'' extensions to UML artefacts, sometimes is the case that generic meta-elements are used instead. 
	For example, in the Archimate for Papyrus tool presented in Section~\ref{sec:efficiencyEvaluation}, the Use Case meta-element is used as base for the \textit{Business Service} \textit{Stereotype}, or Class as the base for the \textit{Business Role} \textit{Stereotype}. 
	Thus, the selection of the most appropriate base element is left for the user.} in the \textit{Stereotype}s of this example\footnote{\textit{Class} is actually \textit{UML::Class}, we omit the ``UML::'' prefix to \sg{reduce the efforts for the user???? (Perhaps ``to improve clarity''?)}}). The shape on the canvas and the icon in the palette for each \textit{Stereotype} are given using the \textit{shape} and \textit{icon} annotation details. We also change the font style by setting the bold details to true (see line 10).
	\item[--] \textbf{Line 19 \& 22} The EReference \textit{familiarWith} and the \textit{Role} EClass are added in the profile as \textit{Stereotype}s that extend the meta-element \textit{Association} of UML (UML::Association). 
	These \textit{Stereotype}s should be represented as links in the diagrams and thus are annotated with the \textit{@Edge} string.
	In contrast to the \textit{familiarWith EReference}, the types the 
	\textit{Roles} edge should be able to connect are not know and need to be 
	specified as properties of the annotation (i.e., \textit{source=``src''} 
	and \textit{target=``tar''}). 
	This denotes that the source/target nodes of this connector are mapped to the values of the
	EReferences: \textit{src} and \textit{tar} respectively. We also set the \sg{font size }\SG{font height in the script} to 15 for the labels of the \textit{familiarWith} edges (see line 19).
	\item[--] \textbf{NB Line 8:} The \textit{next} EReference is not required to be displayed as an edge on the diagram thus it is not annotated with \emph{@Edge}. 
	However, it will be a property of the \textit{Step} \textit{Stereotype} in the generated profile, so it can be set in the model (but it will not be displayed on the diagram).
\end{itemize}


The automated M2M and M2T transformations discussed above are then executed on the Ecore file and the produced SDPL Papyrus editor is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:sdplEditor}.  \thanos{The figure should be updated to include the bold label for Tool and the 15 font for familiarWith.}

		development process are defined and responsible persons are attached to 
		them\\ along with the tools they are specialized on.}
	\label{fig:sdplEditor}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Polishing Transformations}
The generated editor is fully functional but it can be further customised to fit users' custom needs. 
For example, by default, our automatic transformations dictate the diagram, through the CSS file to show the stereotype name applied to each node. 
However, in this example we want to hide the stereotype names and display labels in red font. 
This can be achieved by manually amending the generated CSS file. 
However, the CSS file will be automatically overridden if the user regenerates the profile and the editor in the future (e.g., because of a change in the metamodel). 
To avoid this, the user can use the -- optional -- CSS generation polishing transformation (\#5b in Figure~\ref{fig:transformationWorkflow}) shown in Listing~\ref{lst:cssPolishingExample}. 
Every time the profile and editor generation is executed, the polishing transformation will be called and will set the visibility of the stereotypes to false automatically. 

\begin{figure}
	\lstinputlisting[
	caption={The polishing transformation for the CSS file generation that\\ sets the visibility of the names of the nodes to true.},
	label={lst:cssPolishingExample},
	captionpos=b, 
	language=EGL, 
	tabsize=2, 
	numbers=left, 
	numbersep=5pt, 
	numberstyle=\tiny, 
	breaklines=true]
	{cssPolishingExample.egl}
%	\vspace*{-6mm}
\end{figure}

%\dk{What about inheritance? If a class is annotated as @Node and its 
%subclasses are annotation-less do they inherit the @Node annotation and its 
%details?} Thanos: No...

The EGL template in Listing~\ref{lst:cssPolishingExample} generates a CSS rule in lines 1-3 that sets the visibility property of the stereotypes' labels to false. 
It stores all the elements in the Ecore metamodel that are annotated as @Node (line 6) in a collection and iterates though them in lines 7-10. 
For each of the node stereotypes, it generates the static text ``[appliedStereotypes~='' followed by the name of each stereotype and a comma. 
At the end it prints the curly brackets (lines 10 and 12) and the text ``fontColor:red;'' in line 11. 
The resulted output that is amended automatically in the original CSS file by the polishing transformation is the one shown in Listing~\ref{lst:cssPolishingOutput}.

	breaklines=true]{cssPolishingOutput.egl}
%	\vspace*{-5mm}
\end{figure}

%Beyond providing a disciplined mechanism for customising the produced UML 
%profile and editor polishing transformations also offer an extension point for 
%future evolution of the proposed approach: user defined polishing 
%transformations developed to fulfil scenarios that we do support can be created 
%and submitted to be included in the default transformations of our approach.
