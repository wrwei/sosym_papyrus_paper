\section{Background and Motivation}
\label{sec:background}

In this section we outline the process for defining a UML profile and its supporting graphical editing facilities in Papyrus. 
This process typically involves the manual creation of a number of inter-related models and configuration files.
We motivate the need of automatic generation of these artefacts by highlighting the labour-intensive and error prone activities involved in creating a UML profile and its supporting Papyrus editor.

\subsection{UML Profile}
A UML Profile in Papyrus is an EMF model that conforms to the UML Ecore metamodel. 
In order to create a new UML Profile, developers need to create instances of \textit{Stereotype, Property, Association}, etc. to create the elements of their domain specific modeling languages, their properties and relationships among the elements.

Papyrus offers, among other choices, the mechanism of creating UML profiles using a \textit{Profile Diagram} editor. 
Users can use the palette provided in the UML Profile Diagram editor to create all elements required to form a UML profile.
The properties of each element (e.g., data types of properties, multiplicity, navigability, etc.) can then be set using the properties view. 
In a profile, each \textit{Stereotype} needs to extend a UML concept (hereby referred to as \textit{meta-element}). 
The users need to define which meta-elements their \textit{Stereotype}s extend. 
This is achieved by importing the meta-elements and by adding appropriate extension links between their \textit{Stereotype}s and the meta-elements by using the tool provided in the palette.
The process of creating a UML profile can be repetitive and labour-intensive, depending on the size of the profile.
Having created a profile, users can then apply it to a UML model. 
To do this, users typically create instances of UML meta-elements (e.g., UML::Class) and apply their \textit{Stereotype}s defined in their UML profiles. 
For example, if a \textit{Stereotype} extends the UML::Class meta-element, users can apply it to selected instances of UML::Class in their models. 
In this sense, the users are creating instances of the elements they define in their DSLs. 

One of the limitations of UML profiles in Papyrus is that links between \textit{Stereotype}s can be instantiated as edges in a diagram only if they extend a \textit{connector} meta-element (e.g., UML::Association).  
For example, if `Stereotype A' refers to `Stereotype B' via an `A\_to\_B' reference, then in order to be able to draw this connection as an edge on the diagram, `A\_to\_B' should be created as a separate \textit{Stereotype}. 
These connector \textit{Stereotype}s do not hold any information about the \textit{Stereotype}s that they can connect, so users need to define such restrictions by manually writing OCL constraints to validate at least two things: 1) if the source and target nodes are of the correct type and 2) if the connector is in the correct direction (e.g., for `A\_to\_B'), the edge should lead from `Stereotype A' to `Stereotype B'. 
These constraints can be rather long and need to be manually written and customised for \textit{each} edge \textit{Stereotype}. 
As illustrated in Section~\ref{sec:constraints}, this can also be a labour-intensive and error-prone process.

\subsection{Distributable Custom Graphical Editor}
With the UML profile created, users can apply it to UML diagrams. 
Users select a UML element (e.g., an instance of UML::Class) and manually apply a \textit{Stereotype} in the UML profile they define. 
A \textit{Stereotype} can only be applied to instances of the meta-elements they extend.
For example, a \textit{Stereotype} that extends the UML::Package meta-element in the profile cannot be applied to an instance of UML::Class. 
This task is arguably labour-intensive and repetitive. 
In addition, users typically need to remember the meta-element that each \textit{Stereotype} extends in their UML profile. 
%It is even more 
%problematic in scenarios where the profile was created by someone else. In 
%fact, except from using the profile in their local machine, users can 
%distribute it (all the needed information are stored in a file called 
%``model.profile.uml'') so it can be used by others. 

% Although the aforementioned manual creation and use of the profile sometimes covers all the needs of the stakeholders and includes trade-offs they are willing to take, it is usually the case that stakeholders require the definition of custom shapes for the stereotypes and/or a custom palette of stereotypes. The later is important if one thinks that in smaller profiles, users actually need to navigate through tenths of elements available in the default palette, to pick the one that should be used and apply the stereotype. 
To address this recurring concern, Papyrus offers at least three possible options for creating a custom palette which allows users to create UML elements and apply selected \textit{Stereotype}s on them in a single step. 
%Papyrus provides the facility to customise the palette for an open editor. 
For the first option, users can make use of the customisation facility to create their own palettes, and then specify what \textit{Stereotype}s should be instantiated for the creation tools in the palette.
Although this is an easy-to-use approach, it must be done manually every time a new diagram is created.
In addition, it cannot be shared in case the editor needs to be distributed to collaborators. 
%The first option involves customisation through a user interface where users add elements in the palette for their stereotypes. 
%Although this is an easy-to-use approach, it has to be done manually when a new diagram is created. 
The second option involves the manual definition of an XML-based palette configuration file which is automatically loaded every time the profile is applied to a diagram. 
This option however, is discouraged by Papyrus as it does not allow the full use of Papyrus functionality.
Furthermore, this option is based on a deprecated framework, hence its use is discouraged. 
The third option is to create a Papyrus editor associated to the UML profile, which includes the manual creation of a number of inter-related models and artefacts, including a palette configuration model, an ElementTypesConfiguration model, which is used to associate \textit{Stereotype}s in the UML profile with its UML meta-element and the concrete syntax of the meta-element, etc. 
Although this option provides a whole solution to create a UML profile editor, in the paper we illustrate that it is a labour-intensive and error prone process.

The definition of custom shapes for the instantiated \textit{Stereotype}s is another common requirement. 
In Papyrus, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) shapes can be bound to \textit{Stereotype}s during the profile creation process. 
However, to make these shapes visible, users need to set the visibility of the shape of \textit{each} \textit{Stereotype} to true. 
Although this is an acceptable trade-off, the users typically need to hide the default shapes by writing custom style rules in a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), as by default the SVG shape bound to a \textit{Stereotype} overlaps with the default shape of the base meta-element.
The CSS can be written once but need to be loaded each time \textit{manually} on every diagram that is created.

To create a distributable (i.e. an Eclipse plugin) graphical editor that has diagrams tailored for the profile and to avoid all the aforementioned drawbacks, users need to create a number of inter-related models and files, and to implement extension points in an Eclipse plug-in project. 
Figure~\ref{fig:neededPapyrusFiles_new} shows all the artefacts needed to be created for having a distributable Papyrus UML profile editor for Papyrus 3.0+\footnote{Metamodels for Element Types Configuration, Palette Configuration have been changed since our previous work (pre-Papyrus 3.0, rendered in blue). The Architecture model and the Java Creation Command class are new concepts introduced in Papyrus 3.0+ since our previous work (rendered in green).}.
These artefacts include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item An Element Types Configuration model;
	\item A Palette Configuration model;
	\item A Cascading Style Sheet for customised styles;
	\item A Java Creation Command class to initialise the diagram;
	\item An Architecture model to describe the architecture of the editor;
	\item Plug-in related files for extensions and dependencies.
\end{itemize}

Through our experiment (see Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}), we found out that it is difficult, if not impossible, to create these models without any working examples, taking also into account that the documentation of Papyrus provides limited useful insight in this matter.
%In addition, it is also a labour-intensive and error-prone process to migrate editors created based on Papyrus 2.0 to Papyrus 3.0+. 
%Developers typically need to create new Palette Configuration and Element Types Configuration models, as well as the new concepts such as the Architecture model.

Detailed discussions about the artefacts needed in order to create a UML profile editor are provided in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.
A few hundred lines of code need to be written while tedious and repetitive tasks (e.g., model creation) should be done. 
This is backed by our studies in the evaluation, which is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.

As mentioned in \cite{kehrer2014versioning}, in different phases of the system engineering process, different metamodels created using the same modelling language could be used based on the current phase's needs. 
Papyrus opted for the option that allows the definition of UML profiles based on the UML specifications defined by the OMG standard. 
As a result, it may be the case that problems, when using tools that implement UML, arise due to the use of an inappropriate version of the metamodel by the tool vendors. 
Examples of solutions in tackling such problems that are a result of potential design flaws in OMG specifications are presented in~\cite{alanen2005subset} and~\cite{kelter2008comparing}. 
However, our personal experience, which is verified by the evaluation results, shows that the problems with the creation of UML profiles and graphical editors in Papyrus, arise from the labour-intensive and repetitive tasks related mostly in the definition of all the other artefacts (which are a result of a design decision by the tool vendor) rather than the UML profile itself. 
We argue that this \textit{labour-intensive}, \textit{repetitive} and \textit{error-prone} tasks could be automated. 

In this paper, we present our tool - \textit{Jorvik}, which uses a single-source input to automatically generate a UML profile and models/files mentioned above for the generation of a distributable Papyrus editor that supports the UML profile.
